A simple Bug and Issue Tracker also for MoSCoW-Method</strong><br>
<br>This is a developer focused tracking tool.
It has a modern UI making a very fluid user experience.
It is designed to work without database, on cheap webspace or
100% offline e.g. on localhost, so it is very fast.
Using it should be as simple as copying the script code.
To run simply edit the config and start the index file.
